# Clustering-Models
Incorporates the Machine Learning technique of clustering to group data in an unsupervised fashion. Utilizes the K-Means algorithm to perform Customer Segmentation. Uses an agglomerative algorithm to organize car data in an hierarchical manner. And, uses DBSCAN to create clusters based on location and temperature. The following is coded on a Python Jupyter Notebook.
